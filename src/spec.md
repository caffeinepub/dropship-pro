# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Build a drop shipping management application that enables users to manage products, orders, and suppliers with profit tracking and business metrics.

**Planned changes:**
- Create product catalog with search functionality displaying product details, supplier information, wholesale price, and suggested retail price
- Implement order management system with status tracking (pending, processing, shipped, delivered) and customer order creation
- Build supplier management interface to add, edit, and view supplier details with associated products
- Create dashboard showing key metrics: total products, active orders, pending orders, and total revenue
- Implement automatic profit calculation showing margin between wholesale and retail prices for products and orders
- Design modern, professional interface with warm color palette (avoiding blue/purple), clean typography, and intuitive navigation

**User-visible outcome:** Users can manage their drop shipping business by browsing products, creating and tracking customer orders, managing supplier relationships, viewing business performance metrics on a dashboard, and monitoring profit margins across products and orders.
